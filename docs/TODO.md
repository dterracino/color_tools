## Create class for handling color deficiency functions

This will use a color matrix to convert an image (or a palette) to the various color deficiency types. There will be two possible converrsions - simulation and correction. Simulation remaps the colors in the source so that a person with regular color vision can see a simulation of what someone with a particular color deficiency would see. Correction remaps the colors in the source so that a person with a particular color deficiency can still see the source effectively.
