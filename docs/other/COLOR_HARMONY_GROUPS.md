# Color Harmony Groups & Palette Types

This document outlines standard color harmony relationships based on the 12-spoke color wheel (HSL/HSV models).

## 1. Monochromatic
Derived from a single base Hue. Variations are created by adjusting:
* **Tints:** Adding white (increasing lightness).
* **Shades:** Adding black (decreasing lightness).
* **Tones:** Adding gray (decreasing saturation).

## 2. Complementary
Two colors that are directly opposite each other on the color wheel.
* **Offset:** 180°
* **Vibe:** High contrast, high impact.

## 3. Split-Complementary
A variation of the complementary color scheme. In addition to the base color, it uses the two colors adjacent to its complement.
* **Offsets:** 0°, 150°, 210° (approximate)
* **Vibe:** High contrast but less tension than pure complementary.

## 4. Analogous
Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs.
* **Offsets:** Typically 0°, -30°, +30°
* **Vibe:** Harmonious, often found in nature.

## 5. Triadic
Three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.
* **Offsets:** 0°, 120°, 240°
* **Vibe:** Vibrant, even when using pale or unsaturated versions.

## 6. Tetradic (Double Complementary / Rectangular)
Uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs.
* **Offsets:** 0°, 60°, 180°, 240° (example)
* **Vibe:** Rich and complex. Requires balance (usually one color dominates).

## 7. Square
Similar to Tetradic, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle.
* **Offsets:** 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°
* **Vibe:** Balanced but colorful.

## 8. Compound (Analogous-Complementary)
Often vaguely defined, but typically involves a base hue, its complement, and neighbors of the complement or base.
* **Offsets:** Variable.

## 9. Achromatic
No hue (saturation = 0). Strictly uses black, white, and gray scales.

## 10. Neutral
Colors with very low saturation (browns, beiges, tans) or desaturated hues.
