Great question! Let me brainstorm some easy wins that would be fun and useful. I'll organize these by category:

🎨 Color & Filament Matching Ideas
Color Harmony Generator ⭐ (Strong Recommendation)
Given a color, generate harmonious palettes using color theory:

Complementary (opposite on color wheel)
Analogous (adjacent colors)
Triadic (evenly spaced)
Split-complementary
Tetradic/Square
Why it's great: Designers and artists would love this. It's pure math based on HSL/LCH hue values, so it's easy to implement.

Color Gradient/Interpolation
Generate smooth gradients between two or more colors:

Linear interpolation in LAB space (perceptually uniform)
Specify number of steps
CLI: color-tools gradient --from coral --to navy --steps 10
Why it's great: Useful for data visualization, design work, and understanding color transitions.

Contrast Ratio Calculator ⭐ (Strong Recommendation)
Calculate WCAG contrast ratios between two colors:

Check if text would be readable on a background
Return AA/AAA compliance levels
Suggest similar colors that meet contrast requirements
Why it's great: Accessibility is important, and this is a pure math problem (simple formula).

Color Temperature Analysis
Classify colors as warm/cool and calculate a temperature score:

Based on hue position
Could help with color scheme creation
Why it's great: Simple but adds a nice qualitative dimension to color analysis.

Filament Blend Simulator
Calculate what color you'd get by mixing two filament colors:

Simple RGB averaging or more sophisticated LAB blending
Useful for multicolor 3D printing
🖼️ Image Processing Ideas
Watermarking ⭐ (Your Idea - Excellent!)
Add text or image watermarks:

Position control (corner, center, custom)
Opacity control
Font selection for text watermarks
Why it's great: Super practical for content creators.

Dithering Effects ⭐⭐ (Highly Recommended)
Convert images to limited color palettes with dithering:

Floyd-Steinberg dithering
Ordered (Bayer) dithering
Use any palette (CSS colors, filaments, custom)
Creates retro/artistic effects
Why it's great: This is really fun visually, ties into your existing palette system, and algorithms are well-documented. Would be amazing for retro game aesthetics or artistic effects.

Color Tinting/Overlay
Apply a color tint to an image:

Sepia, warm, cool, custom color overlays
Blend modes (multiply, screen, overlay)
Why it's great: Simple pixel operations, dramatic visual effects.

Pixelation Effect
Reduce image resolution for retro/artistic looks:

Adjustable block size
Optional palette reduction
Why it's great: One-liner algorithm, fun results.

Border/Frame Addition
Add decorative borders to images:

Solid color or gradient borders
Adjustable thickness
