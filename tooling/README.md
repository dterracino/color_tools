# Tooling Scripts

This directory contains various development and data conversion scripts used during the creation and maintenance of this project.

**⚠️ Warning:** These scripts are for internal development purposes only. They should **not** be run or used by end users or contributors.

These tools were used for tasks such as:

- Converting data formats
- Generating or transforming color data files
- One-time data migration scripts
- Development utilities

The scripts may have hardcoded paths, expect specific input formats, or modify data files in ways that could break the package if run incorrectly.
